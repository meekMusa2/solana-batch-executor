Just shipped Solana Batch Executor for the Sanctum Gateway hackathon ðŸš€

Without Gateway: batch transactions fail 5-10% of the time, costing hours debugging
With Gateway: 99%+ success rate via dual RPC + Jito routing, 40-50% cost savings

Gateway's simultaneous routing is a game-changer for reliable batch operations on Solana. See it in action: [your-github-link]
